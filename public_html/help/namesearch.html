<div class=newstitle>Name Searches</div>
<div class=newsline>
Name searches can be done to match exact names or partial names of either individuals or businesses.  
<p>
To specify a search for an individual's exact last name, enter the entire name.  For instance, entering SMITH would find only those cases with the name of SMITH.  Entering SMITHE would find only those with the name of SMITHE.
<p>
To specify a search for a partial last name, use the wildcard character, *, as the last character of the last name.  For instance, if you want to find all cases for the name that starts with the letters SMIT, enter SMIT*.   This search would result with last names like SMITH, SMITHERS, SMITTER, etcetera.  If there is more than one * in the last name, the search will only look for those matches up to the first * character.  If you are doing a last name only wildcard search, there must be at least one character before the asterisk (*).
<p>
In all cases, the search will do a 'like' search for the first name.  A 'like' search is the same as a wildcard search except that you don't use the wildcard character.  In this instance, you can put in the exact first name you are looking for or the first few letters of the first name, known as a partial name. The search results will include all hits that have first names that start with at least the entered letters.
<p>
Since partial name searches can result in large numbers of cases, there is a limit to how many can be listed.  If your search exceeds the limit, an appropriate message is displayed to show you how many cases matched your search and what the limit is, and you will be asked to refine your search.
<p>
Note:  Business name searches are different from individual name searches.  For a business name search, enter the entire business name or the beginning of the name followed by an * character.  Business name searches allow you to enter blank spaces or other punctuation that may be in the business name.
