The Integrated Case Management System allows you to search for cases or pull up case reports for a given judge or division.
<br/><br/>Note that sealed cases are excluded from all searches.

</div><p>

<div class=newstitle>Circuit-Wide Search</div>

<div class=newsline>

Use this to search all of the online case records in the 12th Judicial Circuit. You can search by an individual person's name, a business name, a case number,
or a citation number.   
<p>
When doing a name search, you can opt to search for "SOUNDEX" names by selecting the "'Sounds Like' Name Search" box.  A soundex search will search for names that 
may be spelled differently, but sound the same.
<p>
Indicate the name is a business name by selecting the "Business Names Only" box.  When a business name search is conducted, first names are not used in the search.  The matching will be done on the entire entered string as the business name.  
<p>
Select "All Party Search" to conduct a search for most parties other than attorneys and court personnel.  Here is a complete <a href="allparty.html">list...</a>
<p>
This search normally excludes parties that are attorneys.  If you are interested in finding cases for a particular attorney, select the "Attorney Party Search" box.  
All other party types are excluded from an attorney party search.
<p>
If you only want to include Defendants, select the "Defendant Party Search" box.  This search only looks for party type: DFT.
<p>
A booking photo is generally available for any person who has been booked by the Sarasota Sheriff's Office.  Check "Show Booking Photos" to include them in the results.
<p>
If you want to exclude closed and inactive cases from your search, select the "Active Cases Only" box. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="inactive.html">More...</a>

<p>If you'd like to see all the charges listed in the results, check the "Show Charge Information" box.  Doing this will increase the number of results since the charges are listed for each found item.  For instance, if you are doing a name search and include charges, you will see one line for each charge with that name.  If a person has 10 charges, there will be 10 rows.
