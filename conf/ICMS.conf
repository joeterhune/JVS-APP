#
CODES
# sets values the %CODES hash used by some programs
# format: county-num;variable-name=value
#
#
#
DATABASES
# uses the format: countynum;countyname;host;vendor;casetype;divlist;dohearing;oddval
#
# where: 
#
# countynum is a 2-digit county ID number.
#
# countyname is the county's name
#
# host is the host name in the access.conf file for this database
#
# vendor is one of:
#         FACC: one of the FACC systems (criminal, civil, probate, traffic)
#         CV: Courtview on an non-MS SQL server
#         CV2: CourtView on an MS SQL server
#              (the "case" file is renamed to "cases" on these systems)
#
# casetype is one of:
#         civ: civil system (handled by genciv.pl, crtvdep.pl, genciv.cgi)
#         crim: criminal system (handled by gencrim.pl, gencrim.cgi)
#         prob: probate system (handled by genprob.pl, genprob.cgi)
#         traf: traffic system (handled by gentraf.pl, gentraf.cgi)
#
# divlist gives divisions present in each dbase, separated by colons
#         if multiple divisions should be grouped together
#         they're separated by commas within that group
#         (canonical name for the group is determined by program)
#         (MH for all Mental Health cases, CP for all probate, for ex.)
#
# dohearing=1 if to be included in genhearing.cgi run, 0 otherwise
#
#
# oddval is used by gencrim.pl,genciv.pl,and crtvdep.pl:
#
#        Odd informs gencrim.pl that CJ is crt_desg R, DP is crt_desg J
#        Odd2 informs gencrim.pl that both CJ and DP are 'J')
#           (Normally, CJ cases have crt_desg J)
#
#
#        SPLITCIV causes genciv.pl to to split civil divisions
#             (it produces separate reports by looking at assign.conf)
#             otherwise genciv.pl just groups by division type
#        BADCIV splits civil cases into categories based on casenotes
#
#        JSUFF causes crtvdep.pl to add -J suffix on juvenile docket codes
#
#        oddval is null otherwise.
