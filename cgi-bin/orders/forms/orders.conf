# orders.conf - configuration file for ICMS form orders
#
# 10/26/10 lms Left county support in here, even though we (15th circuit) only has one county.
#              (build on 8th circuits code)
# 05/11    lms Changes for 15th circuit.
#              - added DROPDOWN with choices
#              - added initval for TEXT fields - if 'blank', we'll put 2 spaces in there so the
#                underline (empty field value) won't show on the page
#              - new field: eaddr must contain courthouse address like this:
#                     Main Courthouse, 205 North Dixie Highway, West Sarasota, FL  33401
#                     courthouse, street, city, st zip - - separated by commas
# 05/23/11 lms ORDERS section has been removed.  Now, we have a new file structure for orders.
#              This file contains fields that are sharable for all forms.  Then, there are 
#              individual form files (.form extension) that define each form.  The fields in
#              here are overridden by fields of the same name in the individual files.
#              Also, the processing order (showing entry fields on the entry page) now is 
#              determined by the order of the fields within the form definition - - not by the 
#              order of the field definitions within the files (as it was).
#              Commented out mdate (mail date). Not used by the 15th.
# 05/26/11 lms Minor changes for cities lists.  ddcity and ddallcities
# 05/31/11 lms Removed purs2 checkbox - - Sara doesn't want it.
