\cTALKING TO JUDGES

The Code of Judicial Conduct governing behavior by judges forbids the Judges of the 15th Judicial Circuit to discuss pending cases with the public. Please do not call the Court expecting to speak with a Judge about any case. If you have a comment to make, please mail it to the <b>Sarasota Beach County Clerk's Office (need address)</b>. If you have a question about your case, you may also contact the Clerk's office at <b>(need phone)</b>. However, the Court is only allowed to consider arguments made in court and documents filed by actual parties in the case. They cannot ethically read or consider any other opinions or arguments about the case, and they cannot give legal advice. Thank you.
